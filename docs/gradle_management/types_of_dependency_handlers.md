|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `implementation`      | `implementation "dependency"`   | Adds dependency to compile and runtime classpath.                                     | Most common. Use for dependencies needed by the module itself.                                    |
| `api`                 | `api "dependency"`              | Adds dependency to compile and runtime classpath and exposes it to dependent modules.  | Use when the dependency should be exposed to modules that depend on this module.                  |
| `compileOnly`         | `compileOnly "dependency"`      | Adds dependency to compile classpath only.                                            | Use for dependencies needed only at compile time, such as annotations processors.                 |
| `runtimeOnly`         | `runtimeOnly "dependency"`      | Adds dependency to runtime classpath only.                                            | Use for dependencies needed only at runtime, such as logging frameworks.                          |
| `testImplementation`  | `testImplementation "dependency"` | Adds dependency to both compile and runtime classpath for the test source set.        | Use for test dependencies, such as JUnit or Mockito.                                              |
| `testCompileOnly`     | `testCompileOnly "dependency"`  | Adds dependency to compile classpath of test source set only.                         | Use for compile-time dependencies needed only for tests.                                          |
| `testRuntimeOnly`     | `testRuntimeOnly "dependency"`  | Adds dependency to runtime classpath of test source set only.                         | Use for dependencies needed only at test runtime.                                                 |
| `annotationProcessor` | `annotationProcessor "dependency"` | Adds an annotation processor to the project.                                        | Use for dependencies that process annotations at compile time, such as Dagger or Room.           |
| `kapt`                | `kapt "dependency"`             | Adds an annotation processor specifically for Kotlin projects.                        | Use when using annotation processors with Kotlin, such as Dagger or Room.                         |
